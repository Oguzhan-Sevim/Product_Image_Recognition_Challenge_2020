# Product_Image_Recognition_Challenge_2020

This is a Spring 2020 term long image processsing and recognition challange. The data set consists of approximately 10000 RGB product images and 100 classes. From part 1 to 4, same data set will be experimented with different feature extraction methods, augmentation methods, low-level statistical classifiers and pretrained deep learning models.

# Part-1:
In the first part of the challenge, color histograms and gradient orientation histograms are used as descriptors. Then, a simple Nearest Neighbor classification rule is applied on the test images. More detailed description and the results can be found in decription.pdf and report.pdf files respectively.

# Part-2:
